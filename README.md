Welcome to my Hangman Game
By: Rahul Gupta

This is your typical game of Hangman where I went further in terms of the styling and UI to give the user realtime feedback. 

The theme, essentially the background image, music and typewriter styled letters arose from a trip to a speakeasy bar I visted in New Orleans.

As you can see below the letters that were selected but not part of the secret word have changed to a background color of red and the letters that were selected and part of the secret word have changed to a background color of green. The letters that have yet to be selected from have a unselected/plain background. 

In this scenario the user was not able to correctly guess the secret word given that you have up to 6 incorrect guesses available to you at which point the complete gallow is shown and the updated message above.

This last image below shows you a winning game were the user was able to succesfully able to guess the word in which case the winning message is relayed.

The technologies used in the project include HTML, CSS, Javascript as well as a custom font that was downloaded and pulled in through CSS.

Next Steps: I think the majority of the next steps were actually all features that I was initally hoping I would be able to get done throughout the project week which was the idea of having multiple difficulty levels where the difficulty determined the extend or limit of time you had in addition to the character length of the word being guesses. 

In addition to these features, I would also like to integreate more animations because this was a slightly more simple theme and even possibly introduce the idea of having 2 players where one user can enter a word through a prompt and the second user would then guess what that word is. 

Lastly a true game of hangman does usually take the theme further in the idea that each word that is pulled has an associated hit message in order for the user to guess the word to I would definitely like to build on the game with this feature down the road. 

Although this week was tough and I was sick I ultimately think time management is a big part of working through this program and being able to hit the milestones of the alpha and beta which I struggled with; not to mention my lack of git commits. I hope to better plan with my future projects and have better code, more semantic and constant git commits and even finishing in advance rather then just on time.
